__________________________________________________________________


An advisory by EnableSecurity in collaboration with Acunetix. 

Advisory URL: 
http://resources.enablesecurity.com/advisories/openx-2.6.4-multiple.txt

Version: OpenX 2.6.4 and older versions

Description:

OpenX is an online advertising web application written in PHP that supports popular sites such as TechCrunch, SUN Microsystems and Metacafe. 

From their website (openx.org):
"OpenX is a free, open source ad server that manages the selling and delivery of your online advertising inventory. You can get OpenX as a hosted service or as downloaded software."

Credits:

These vulnerabilities were discovered during testing of AcuSensor Technology feature in Acunetix WVS.
We worked with the OpenX security team to have these security flaws reported and fixed. 
We would like to publicly thank the OpenX team for their prompt response!

Technical details:

The following vulnerabilities were identified:

Major issues:
  - SQL injection
  - Cross Site Scripting

Other issues:
  - Arbitrary File Deletion
  - CRLF injection



----------- Major issues -----------

::::: SQL vulnerabilities :::::

[[ Trigger: /adview.php ]] 

Description: 
The cookie "OAID" is not filtered when adview.php is accessed and used directly to construct the SQL INSERT statement. 

[[ Trigger: /www/delivery/tjs.php ]]

Description: 
1. The cookie "OAID" is not filtered when adview.php is accessed and used directly to construct the SQL INSERT statement. 
2. The "referer" parameter in the GET request is also used in the SQL statement and is another vector.



::::: XSS Vulnerabilities :::::

[[ Trigger: /www/admin/sso-accounts.php ]] 

Description:
The "email" parameter in the POST data is simply printed out in the html page, allowing injection of HTML i.e. XSS attacks. 

----------- Possible issues ----------- 


::::: Arbitary file deletion :::::

[[ Trigger: /www/delivery/tjs.php ]]

Reason:
May not be easily exploitable but it does allow directories to be traversed when deleting cache files. 

Exploitation: 
It does not seem to be exploitable on Linux, but might be exploitable on Windows. On Linux the following path would not open: /etc/../asdf/../passwd because "asdf" does not exist. However the following works on Windows: C:\asdf\..\boot.ini, even if "asdf" does not exist.


::::: CRLF Injection :::::

Reason: 
It seems that the current version of PHP does not allow headers with multiple lines, i.e ones that contain the carraige and return line feed characters. Therefore OpenX does not appear to be exploitable. However, the code does allow CRLF injection and this may be exposed in some other way *(eg. old versions of PHP ?). 

[[ Trigger: /adframe.php ]]

[[ Trigger: /adjs.php ]]

[[ Trigger: /www/delivery/tjs.php ]]
